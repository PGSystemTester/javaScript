# JavaScript Repository
This is a place I'm dumping some javaScript links, procedures or anything else that might prove useful. 

This is just for reference, not an actual project.

## Code Resource Tools
- [HTML CheatSheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/) Honestly this is the ultimate cheat sheet.
- [W3Schools JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) Great place to start if you want online tutorial courses with examples, but without instructor.
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io) Good for experimenting with real code.

## Help Boards
- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) I've spent a lot of time on here....
